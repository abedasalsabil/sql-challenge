# sql-challenge

Hello! my name is Abeda Salsabil. This is my first SQL assignment. 

You can find my table schemas and query in the EmployeeSQL folder, and the data tables in the folder called 'data' in 'm9-starter-code'

I would like to thank my instructor, Madhur, for enabling me and my peers to be able to do SQL quries, a very important tool to use in the real world and hopefully at my future job. 


Thank you!
